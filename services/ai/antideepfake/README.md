## 📢 News and Updates
[Oct. 16, 2025] We corrected previous implementation of EER calculation, and updated the code, result tables in arXiv and Hugging Face. I applogize for the mistake.

[Sep. 20, 2025] Add functions and a demo notebook for drift detection. Please check details [README_drift.md](./README_drift.md).

[July 4, 2025] We added supplementary information to our training data to help guide your selection of which data to use. Please check [here](./protocols/README.md).

[June 27, 2025] Initial release!!!


## Introduction

The AntiDeepfake project provides a series of powerful foundation models post-trained for deepfake detection. The AntiDeepfake model can be used for feature extraction for deepfake detection in a zero-shot manner, or it may be further fine-tuned and optimized for a specific database or deepfake-related task.

For more technical details and analysis, please refer to our paper [Post-training for Deepfake Speech Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21090).

Inference script is available on each model’s [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/collections/nii-yamagishilab/antideepfake-685a1788fc514998e841cdfc) page. Simply copy some audio files and run the script to get their detection scores. 

To train or run large-scale evaluations and save the score files for analysis, please follow the steps below.

## Installation
This setup is recommended if you plan to run custom experiments with the code. The commands below provides the same behavior as running `install.sh`.

```shell

conda create --name antideepfake python==3.9.0
conda activate antideepfake
conda install pip==24.0
# Keep pip at 24.0 before installing requirements.
# Newer pip versions can reject omegaconf 2.0.x metadata pulled by fairseq.

## Usage in details

### 0. Working directory structure

We assume the following project structure. This is provided as a reference to help understand how the code and data are organized:

```
/base_path/                 # The root of the project that contains data,
│                           # code, and experiment
│
├── Data/                   # Contains multiple databases
│   ├── ASVspoof2019-LA/    # Example database
│   ├── ASVspoof2021-DF/    # Example database
│   ├── ...                 # Other databases
│
├── fairseq/                # Directory for fairseq installation
├── speechbrain/            # Directory for speechbrain installation
│
├── Log/                    # Stores log files and model checkpoints
│   ├── exps/               # Directory for experiment outputs
│   ├── ssl-weights/        # Contains downloaded checkpoint files
│
│
├── AntiDeepfake/           # This AntiDeepfake repository
│   ├── hparams             # Configuration files
│   │   ├── xx.yaml         # 
│   ├── ...                 # Code files
│   ├── protocols/
│   │   ├── xx.py           # python script for generating protocols
│   │   ├── train.csv       # The generated training set protocol
│   │   ├── valid.csv       # The generated validation set protocol
│   │   ├── test.csv        # The generated test set protocol

```

The folder structure can be altered. By doing so, please remember to change the path variables in `hparams/*.yaml`.

### 1. Generate protocols

Training and inference scripts provided in this repository are designed to load audio files listed in train/valid/test CSV files in `protocols`.

In the demonstration above, we used `protocols/toy_example_test.csv` to do inference. You can check the content of this CSV file.

Python scripts for generating database protocols are provided in `protocols`. Each script is named after the database it processes. 

All protocols are designed to follow the same format so we can easily shuffle, split, or merge them. To merge multiple CSV protocols as in our experiment, you can refer to `generate_protocol_by_proportion.py`.

To generate protocols for your own data:

- refer to `toy_example.py` and the downloaded toy_example.tar.gz for example.
- refer to `ASVspoof2019-LA.py` if you have a protocol file with ground truth labels for each audio file.
- refer to `CVoiceFake.py` if your real and fake audios are stored separately.
- refer to `WildSVDD.py` if your audio filenames indicate whether they are real or fake.

### 2. Download checkpoints

Our code creates the models using configuration files. Their front ends are initialized with random weights.

* If you do inference without post-training or fine-tuning, please download an AntiDeepfake checkpoint (see example in Usage Demonstration above). The weights of the front end and the rest of the model will be overwritten using the AntiDeepfake checkpoint.

* If you do post-training or fine-tuning upon an AntiDeepfake checkpoint, please download the AntiDeepfake checkpoint. The weights of the front end and the rest of the model will be overwritten using the AntiDeepfake checkpoint.

* If you want to do your own post-training using Fairseq pre-trained SSL front ends, please download Fairseq checkpoints. The weights of the front end will be re-initialized using the Fairseq checkpoint.

### 3. Training

To post-train or fine-tune upon an AntiDeepfake checkpoint (e.g., MMS-300M):
```
python main.py hparams/mms_300m.yaml \
    --base_path /your/base_path \
    --exp_name fine_tuning \
    --lr 1e-6 \
    # Perform full validation every 2025 mini-batches
    --valid_step 2025 \
    # Enable RawBoost data augmentation
    --use_da True \
    # Initialize model weights with AntiDeepfake checkpoint
    --ckpt_path /path/to/your/downloaded/antideepfake/mms_300m.ckpt
```

To start post-train with a Fairseq checkpoint (e.g., MMS-300M):
```
python main.py hparams/mms_300m.yaml \
    --base_path /your/base_path \
    --exp_name post_training \
    --lr 1e-7 \
    --valid_step 100000 \
    # Disable RawBoost data augmentation
    --use_da False \
    # Initialize model weights with Fairseq checkpoint (default setting)
    --ckpt_path /base_path/Log/ssl-weights/base_300m.pt
```

Notes:
1. Configuration YAML files are named after the model they correspond to. Please use the corresponding configuration file in `hparams`.
2. Training logs and checkpoints will be saved under `/base_path/Log/exps/exp_mms_300m_<exp_name>`.
3. If the above `exp` folder already exists, the script will try to resume training from the last saved checkpoint in the folder.
4. For multi-GPU training, please use:
```bash
torchrun --nnodes=1 --nproc-per-node=<NUM_GPU> main.py hparams/<MODEL>.yaml
```

### 4. Inference and evaluation

#### Inference (generating CSV score)

For using the best validation checkpoint from your own experiment:
```
python main.py inference hparams/mms_300m.yaml \
    --base_path /your/base_path \
    # Exp folder name must match the name used during training
    --exp_name fine_training \
    --test_csv /path/to/your/test.csv
```
The script will automatically search for the best validation checkpoint in the specified experiment folder `/base_path/Log/exps/exp_mms_300m_<exp_name>`. It will generate an `evaluation_score.csv` file in the same folder.


For using AntiDeepfake checkpoints without training:
```
python main.py inference hparams/mms_300m.yaml \
    --base_path /your/base_path \
    # Use a new exp folder name to avoid conflicts
    --exp_name eval_antideepfake_mms_300m \
    --test_csv /path/to/your/test.csv
    # Initialize model weights with AntiDeepfake checkpoint
    --ckpt_path /path/to/your/downloaded/antideepfake/mms_300m.ckpt
```

#### Evaluating CSV score
Run:
```
python evaluation.py /path/to/your/evaluation_score.csv
```
You will get results similar to this:
```
===== METRICS SUMMARY =====
For accuracy, precision, recall, f1, fpr and fnr, threshold of real class probablity is 50.00%

        roc_auc  accuracy  precision  recall      f1     fpr     fnr     eer  eer_threshold
subset

```

The row `Pooled` show results computed over all scores listed in the score file. By default, we use 0.5 as the probability threshold for evaluation. You can change this threshold by:
```
python evaluation.py /path/to/your/evaluation_score.csv 0.7
```

If your test set contains files from multiple dataset and you want to check results of a specific subset (i.e., file IDs start with a common prefix string), run:
```
python evaluation.py /path/to/your/evaluation_score.csv ASV19LAdemo ...  
```
You will get results like this:
```

# Our fine-tuning results

The released AntiDeepfake checkpoints are post-trained checkpoints. They can be fine-tuned to a specific task in a specific domain.

Described below is the performance of fine-tuning AntiDeepfake models on Deepfake-Eval-2024 train set (PT = Pre-training, PST = Post-training, FT = Fine-tuning, 4s = Input Duration is 4 seconds).

Please note that we do not provide these fine-tuned checkpoints.
